This repository contains jupter notebooks corresponding to the appendices of my PhD thesis "Matroids, Flag Varieties, and Generalized Permutahedra".

In Appendix_A we compute the inverse limit obtained from a matroidal subdivision of the (2,4)-hypersimplex.

In Appendix_B we demonstrate some of the OSCAR tools to study realization spaces of matroids.
